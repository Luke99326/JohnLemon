## Unity Version
I ran into issues with unity 2021.2.14 but it 100% works with unity 2020.3.0 (tutorial version)

## Particle Effect
All ghosts have a particle effect following them as they walk around, no trigger is required.

## Linear Interpolation
As the player gets closer to the ghosts, the color of the ghost's particles will change from light blue to light red based on how close the player is.

## Dot Product
In the top left of the game there are 4 lines of text (1 for each ghost) to tell the player which ghosts are behind them and which are in front.

## Team Members
Just me :)

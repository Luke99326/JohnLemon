## Unity Version
I ran into a couple of issues with unity 2021.2.14. The particle effects/lerp/dot product still works, but some of the lighting and visual effects don't. It is 100% working on unity 2020.3.0 (tutorial version.)

## Particle Effect
All ghosts have a particle effect following them as they walk around, no trigger is required.

## Linear Interpolation
As the player gets closer to the ghosts, the color of the ghost's particles will change from light blue to light red based on how close the player is.

## Dot Product
In the top left of the game there are 4 lines of text (1 for each ghost) to tell the player which ghosts are behind them and which are in front.

## Team Members
Just me :)
